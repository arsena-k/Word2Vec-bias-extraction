For a review of Word2Vec check out this [blog post](http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/). We also include code in this notebook to evaluate model quality on the Google Analogy Test on any trained Word2Vec model, and explore any trained Word2Vec model."

We do not remove stop words, which we consider meaningful, and Word2Vec well equipped to extract any meaning from stop words if it is there (i.e., if a stopword predicts other words' meaning), or to place little emphasis on stop words (or noise) if they do not predict other words' meaning. We also do not stem words. On smaller datasets stemming can be a strategy to reduce the vocabulary size and increase the number of instances of each vocabulary word, but the vocabulary size of the data set we initially trained on (New York Times articles) was a large corpus, and so we can use unstemmed words."

Skip-gram sets up the artificial neural network underlying Word2Vec to predict set of context words given a target word. CBOW, or Context Bag of Words, sets up the network to predict a target word given a set of context words. The number of context words used is set by the \"window\" parameter. \n",

We've seen up to 1000, but usually see 100, 300, and sometimes 500 dimensions on larger corprora. If you have a smaller dataset, stick to smaller dimensionality, roughly 50-200. Even 100 dimensions is a lot to learn! And, if you are using the embeddings for a classifiation task down the road (like in Part C of this GitHub Repo), it might be better to keep dimensionality low. \n",

    "The **Google Analogy Test** is one of the most accepted strategies to evaluate how \"good\" or high quality your model is. The Google Analogy Test includes a series of analogies divided up into 15 subsections, including world capitals, countries’ currencies, family, and a series of syntactic sections such as tense and plurality.  For example, an analogy in the semantic section of World Capitals will include: “Berlin: Germany as Paris: ?” and if the model responds correctly it will return: “France.” An analogy in the semantic section of family will include: “Mother: Father as Daughter: Son.” In the syntax section with tense, a sample analogy might be “Walk: Walked as Run: Ran.”  The Google Analogy test includes a total of 20,000 questions, and accuracy is the proportion of these questions that the model answers correctly. A \"better\" model should answer more questions correctly. As we'll see, this isn't the best measure but it is a good starting point. "

    "When originally published, Word2Vec averaged at around 60% across all sections of the Google Analogy Test. Models I've trained on a large news corpus tend to average between 50 and 60%. On smaller coropora, or more heterogenous corpora, accuracy rates might even hover around 0. The Google Analogy test is a useful benchmark, but may be more or less meaningful on different datasets. For example, we might not expect it provide useful infomration on a historical dataset, which contains different language and knoweldge (e.g., some currencies and capitals were likely different at the time the data was produced). For some datasets, it may be useful to select certain sections that are more meaninful than others, such as dropping the section on money for a data set on narratives. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even with low performance on this test, vectors might still contain meaningful, interesting information, but might not be robust or high quality enough for more complex tasks. You can also try tweaking the hyperparameters used to improve performance, especially the dimensionality, context window, and learning architecture. "
